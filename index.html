 <!-- For accessibility, I incorporated the use of alt tags in order to define my images. I also used larger font sizes to make it easier to read even from far away. One thing I did on this site different from my B&B site was add hovering over my navigation bar. I really liked adding this because I felt like it gave my website a more cleaner look and function to it. For ideation, I really liked the previous setup I did with my B&B site, however I did make a few altercations which included using a different color theme and set up within texts.  -->
